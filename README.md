# Linux-Flyer

**Moved to GitLab: https://gitlab.com/Moini/Linux-Flyer**

A flyer introducing Linux created for Linux Presentation Day 2015 in Germany. It's available in German and English in editable format. Both languages are in the same file, just toggle the layers containing 'en' or 'de'.

It's intended to be exported in two halves for double-sided printing on A4 (or it could be used as a poster).
